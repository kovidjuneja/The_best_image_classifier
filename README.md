## Brief Overview
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This project entailed developing a machine learning model that can accurately classify real and AI-generated images. Initially, we utilized the CIFLAKE dataset, the details of which are outlined below, and then employed Beautiful Soup to generate additional images, integrating them with the CIFLAKE dataset. The image contents can be found in test.zip and train.zip.

CIFLAKE:- This dataset comprises around 120,000 low-res images divided into 100,000 for training and 20,000 for testing. Access the dataset at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images


Then we preprocessed the images, extracted their features, split the training data into training and validation sets. Next, we built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network based classifier model using a dataset of approximately 100,000 images.

## Model
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The model used VGG16 as the base model, followed by flattening the data, then a Dense layer of 256 units, followed by a dropout of 0.5, and finally a sigmoid activation layer.
